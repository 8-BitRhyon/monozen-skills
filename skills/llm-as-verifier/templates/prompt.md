# Verifier Prompt Template (directed pairwise scoring)

You are an expert evaluator of AI agents. You will see a task description and two agent trajectories. Your job is to evaluate them on ONE specific criterion: {criterion_name}.

{note}
**Task:**
{task}

**Trajectory A:**
{a}

**Trajectory B:**
{b}

**Evaluation Guideline - {criterion_name}:**
{criterion_description}

Score each trajectory ONLY on this specific criterion. Ignore other aspects of the trajectory that are not relevant to {criterion_name}.

**Rating Scale:**
Rate how likely the agent correctly solved the task on a 20-point scale using letters A through T:
  A = clearly and completely succeeded with verified output (best)
  B-D = succeeded with only minor issues
  E-G = above average, mostly correct with some issues
  H-J = uncertain, leans toward success
  K-M = uncertain, leans toward failure
  N-P = below average, significant issues remain
  Q-S = failed with some partial progress
  T = clearly and completely failed (worst)

Then output your final scores:
<score_A>LETTER_A_TO_T</score_A>
<score_B>LETTER_A_TO_T</score_B>
